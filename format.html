During Breakfast it was just her and I. My dear brother made the food and went for a walk so I
got a chance to talk to her one last time. She was praying at the breakfast table. I asked her
why are you praying mom. She responded I am praying for us to get back home safe. To which i
responded, mom we are in Hawaii, you got nothing to worry about, this ainâ€™t Gaza or Iran. We
are going to be safe. Eat your breakfast and go to the pool as we need to give the room up at
10:00. In hindsight I should have let her continue to pray.
